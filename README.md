## Describe the OOP design of your GWack Slack Simulator

Please provide a short description of your programming progress

[The programming process for me was time consuming despite me being facinated with the outcome. So with the Simlator despite coding it i enjoyed being able to see that it worked when I was able to connect and see tjat I was able to vivivdly see my peers typing an dengaging with e. But also time consuming as I was on a time crunch to get the extra points while fufiling the overall design of the project]

## What additional features did you attempt and how can we test them

[The features portion is the one that took me the most time as I wanted to be differnet and unique in the fact that I wanted the colors to be different and vibrant when you logged in. When you first enter you will see that the color is a bage white or beige white dependeing on how you spell it. With various options and labels being placed above. for one the staus of where you are at, at the given tim. with the indication of what you want your name to be and such more. What I enjoyed the most with the extra ffeautures was the implemetnation of my light and darkmode 
the dark mode will not be activated until you switch it and send a message. As of everything else (like the fonts and such). The darkmode for me provides a vscode like enviorment which is ideal being a s major but also a sort of glowy feeling that I enjoyed. Aside from that the other features are great and I hope you enjoy and try out the feautures. If anything I would mostly suggest trying out the darkmode wuith bolded letters ]
